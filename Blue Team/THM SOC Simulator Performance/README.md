# THM SOC Simulator Performance
The TryHackMe SOC simulator simulates a real SOC environment, with playbooks, SIEMs, Alert Triaging, and report writing.

Here, you will see the scenarios I've tried, as well as each attempt. Each attempt's markdown file also has a link in it, which will send you to the summary of that attempt.

Thanks!
