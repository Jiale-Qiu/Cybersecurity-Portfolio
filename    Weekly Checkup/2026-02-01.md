# Weekly Checkup: February 1st, 2026

This past week, I have been taking the Advanced Endpoint Investigations course on TryHackMe. I have finished learning the Windows Incident Surface, where it discusses possible entry points and locations where an attacker could be hiding. It also discussed the importance of bringing your own system tools when analyzing a live system, as an attacker could modify preinstalled tools like cmd.exe or powershell. This room has taught me a lot about investigating Windows, and I am excited to learn more.
